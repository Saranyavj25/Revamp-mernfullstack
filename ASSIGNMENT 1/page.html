    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>In common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global
        average temperature—and its effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader
        sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global
        average temperature is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution. 
        Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices add to greenhouse 
        gases.[5] These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight,
        warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas driving global 
        warming, has grown by about 50% and is at levels unseen for millions of years.</p>
